# Atlas

Atlas is a complete rewrite of the network modeling and monitoring tool we have been using in-house since 2009.
Since then, browser support for SVG and HTML5 has matured and a new web app framework called Mojolicious has emerged.
This version of Atlas tries to exploit those technologies to overcome some critical limitations of the original version,
allowing for new and exciting features that were impossible to implement in a monolithic, blocking web application.

Planned features:
	Web GUI with intuitive panning, drag & drop
 	Controller, model, template and layout separation
	Non-blocking database queries and I/O
	Email and text message alerts with grouping, prioritization and filtering
	Flexible interface for hot import/export
	Flexible interface for external commands such as scripts
